# ChocAn

Chocaholics Anonymous simulator

# Building

The binary can be built with ```make release```.
We've mainly tested on GNU/Linux x86_64.

# Testing

The default make target runs testing, linting, and formatting.
If testing fails, it may be necessary to run the testing again to create
directories.
